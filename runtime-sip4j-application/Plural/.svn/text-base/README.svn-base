Plural is a sound modular typestate checking tool for Java that employs 
fractional permissions to allow flexible aliasing control. Plural supports 
atomic blocks to check concurrent programs. Typestates can be used to define 
object protocols with finite state machines; Plural's protocols can involve 
multiple interacting objects. The tool is an Eclipse plugin that relies on the 
Crystal static analysis framework. It also uses the Antlr parser generator, 
which is released under the BSD license, which is included with the Antlr binaries.
